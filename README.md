# Inverse-of-x-minus-sin-x-
Calculates the inverse of x minus sin x

This problem came up in the calculation of the surface area of a cylinder underwater given the cylinder is of radius R height H initially filled with water to height h < H/2, then tipped on its side so its axis is horizontal.

  Underwater area = 2pihR^2/H + RHtheta
  
where

  theta - sin(theta) = 2hpi/H

e.g. ./invxminussinx.bin 7.4100861

Output:-

8.308540779715404 - sin(8.308540779715404) = 7.410086099999999
